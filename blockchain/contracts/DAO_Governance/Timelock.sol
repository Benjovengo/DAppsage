    - `admin`: optional account to be granted admin role; disable with zero

    after deployment without being subject to delay, but this role should be
    subsequently renounced in favor of administration through timelocked
    proposals. Previous versions of this contract would assign this admin to the
    deployer automatically and should be renounced as well.
